## 🛠 Tech Stack & Why I Used It
### 1. **HTML5**
   - Base structure of the website.
   - Chosen because it is universal, lightweight, and supported everywhere.

### 2. **Tailwind CSS**
   - Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
   - Benefits:
     - Speeds up design with prebuilt classes.
     - Makes the site responsive quickly.
     - Easy customization without writing long CSS files.

### 3. **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**
   - Handles animations, scroll reveals, and starfield background.
   - Used for interactive contact form (form validation + submission).
   - Avoided frameworks (like React) to keep the project lightweight.

### 4. **Web3Forms API**
   - Used for handling contact form submissions.
   - Benefits:
     - No backend required.
     - Sends form data directly to your email.
     - Easy integration with just an `access_key`.

### 5. **FontAwesome & Icons**
   - For social media links and UI icons.
   - Provides consistent vector icons without extra design work.
